    "### Basic Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Exception Handling handles errors that occur during the execution of a program. Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly. Let’s look at an example:"

    "#### Difference Between Exception and Error\n",
